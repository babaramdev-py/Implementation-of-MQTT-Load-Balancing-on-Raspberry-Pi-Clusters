# Implementation of MQTT Load Balancing on Raspberry Pi Clusters
This project aims to set up a Raspberry Pi cluster that basically takes code and runs it and sends the result back to the user.  

# Objective of The Project
Our aim is to design a highly scalable and an efficient cluster of Raspberry Pi Nodes that can be used parallely to compute code and return results. These are highly in demand for large scale Online Judges like HackerRank, LeetCode, CodeForces etc. The proposed system is cheap, efficient and fast. We can easily run code on this cluster and use this cluster as an intermediate that handles code computation for us. Instead of employing and assigning processes on the main server, we submit the code text to the cluster, this cluster handles the computation for us in a highly efficient and a parallelised approach.
